# About The Project
Animal Cooking is a frantic game in which two players will have to test their cooking skills in the annual culinary competition. To become the best chefs, you will have to overcome 31 levels, across 5 different biomes, overcoming the obstacles you encounter along the way. Find the ingredients, feed your customers, clean up, avoid burning the food and, above all, do it as a team! Enjoy this wonderful project and remember:

Pay attention to the cooking and don't forget to check the fire!!!!

<!-- Tell the world what are the main technologies/libraries behind this project -->
<!-- ### Built With -->

Animal cooking is a game made by a group of 10 students with the aim of learning how to create videogames from scratch, without the conveniences offered by the most popular videogame engines nowadays.
Everything in the game has been created from scratch, from the code, to the art, to even the music. To achieve this we have made use of C++ as the programming language, and SDL to put all the pieces together.
